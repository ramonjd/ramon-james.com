#### 1.0.0-rc2

As of this version release notes can be found at [Releases](https://github.com/DominicTobias/universal-react/releases)

#### 1.0.0-rc1

	- Hot reloading for reducers
	- Stop app errors during server-side render from being silently swallowed in a promise
	- `readyOnActions` returns a Promise which simplifies calling code
	- Use Object.assign babel plugin
	- Remove cruft/simplify
	- Removed mocking in preference for having a real mock api
	- Removed css/file loaders as they were too opinionated and not MVP
	- Refactored app config so it's not a shared global but a shared import
	- Use `componentDidMount` for `readyOnAction` calling as `componentWillMount` can leave the store in a half-way state when sent to the client
